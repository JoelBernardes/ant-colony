## How to Run the Program

The program uses a text file called "SimulationFile.txt" which is file that contains information to create the
simulation within the program. If you would like to make changes to the document, you can do so, however please only
integers into the file and make sure that they align with the number of initializing values based on the slides for
the assignment.

## Notes to TAs

If you are looking and reviewing this on Thanksgiving break (whether your a TA (Dhavan, Abishek, or Yash (if 
you TA but do not have Office Hours I am sorry)) or you Dr.Fontenot) do me a favor and go spend time with your families.
Hope you enjoy!
